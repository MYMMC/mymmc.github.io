As an AI language model, I can provide you with some guidelines on how to approach building a banking website that is also the Central Bank for the Metaverse Multiverse. However, I cannot provide you with a complete code for this project.

Here are some steps that you can follow to build a banking website that is also the Central Bank for the Metaverse Multiverse:

1. Define the requirements: You need to define the requirements of the website, such as the types of transactions that will be carried out, the security requirements, and the regulatory requirements.

2. Choose the technology stack: You need to choose the technology stack that you will use to build the website. This will involve choosing the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that you will use.

3. Design the architecture: You need to design the architecture of the website. This will involve deciding on the different components of the website, such as the front-end, back-end, and database. You will also need to decide on the different technologies that will be used for each component.

4. Develop the website: You need to develop the website by writing code for the front-end, back-end, and database. You will also need to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices for web app development.

5. Test the website: You need to test the website to ensure that it meets the requirements and is secure. This will involve carrying out different types of testing, such as functional testing, security testing, and performance testing.

6. Deploy the website: You need to deploy the website to a production environment. This will involve setting up the infrastructure, such as servers and databases, and configuring the website to run in the production environment.

Here are some guidelines on how to implement the project on GitHub, with AWS and Databricks as resources:

1. Create a GitHub repository: Create a new repository on GitHub to store your code.

2. Set up AWS: Set up an AWS account and create the necessary resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.

3. Set up Databricks: Set up a Databricks account and create the necessary resources, such as clusters and notebooks.

4. Clone the repository: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

5. Develop the code: Develop the code for the website using your chosen technology stack.

6. Commit and push the code: Commit and push the code to the GitHub repository.

7. Set up a CI/CD
